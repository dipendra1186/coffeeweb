          <p>A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee of various types, notably espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

          <p>Coffee happens to be one of the most popular beverages, yes, even more than alcohol. There is nothing better than spending an hour at a café with your favourite people, or even alone! A café is truly the best place to hang out, especially with its overall ambiance. An integral part of this ambiance is the amazing menu you provide. To create a good menu, you could look up some café menu templates. You can also see Coffee Menu Templates. A good coffee menu template sample allows you to list all the different coffees and cappuccinos you serve. You can even add a list of light snacks that would go perfectly with the coffee. Images form an important part of a menu; with a such a template, adding images become a piece of cake. You can also see Menu Templates.</p>
